Mental Health Awareness Game
This is a fun game for creating awareness about mental health. In this game you have to steer clear of obstacles which are: self-doubt, anxiety, fear (in the form of emojis),
and try to hit boosters which are: laughter, proper sleep, yoga/exercise. For every obstacle you hit your stress levels increase by 100 and for every booster you hit the stress
levels decrease by 25. Once stress levels go above 500, the game ends saying "Your stress levels have become very high!! You need to have some rest."
